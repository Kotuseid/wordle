# wordle
I created this after wondering if I was able to program this myself since I saw everyone around me playing it. It works at a sufficient level for my expectations.

### To do
* Make better alerts for when a word is not in the list
* Add a win distribution table
* Make the win/lose screen better
* Add a button for playing again if user closes the win/lose screen
* Make it run faster
* Maybe sound effects
* Check if it actually runs well in mobile and tablet devices and make it a responsive design
